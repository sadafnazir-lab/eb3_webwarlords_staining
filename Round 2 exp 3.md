Experiment 3: **Simple and differential staining of microorganisms and their examination.**

**1.Story Outline:**

Staining techniques involve the application of a dye to the sample to oberve microorganisms under a microscope. Staining is simple or differential. In simple staining, a single dye is used to emphasize particular structures in the specimen. In contrast, differential staining distinguishes organisms based on their interactions with multiple stains. In other words, two organisms in a differentially stained sample may appear to be different colours. Examples include Gram staining, acid-fast staining, endospore staining, flagella staining, and capsule staining.

**2.Story:**

A simple stain involves the use of a single dye. The smear is placed on a slide and dye added to it. The slide is then view under microscope. In contrast,  **differential staining**  involves interactions with multiple stains. First,  **crystal violet** , a  **primary stain** , is applied to a heat-fixed smear, giving all of the cells a purple colour. Next,  **Gram&#39;s iodine** , a  **mordant** , is added. A mordant is a substance used to set or stabilize stains or dyes; in this case, Gram&#39;s iodine acts like a trapping agent that complexes with the crystal violet, making the crystal violetâ€“iodine complex clump and stay contained in thick layers of peptidoglycan in the cell walls. Next, a  **decolorizing agent**  is added, usually ethanol or an acetone/ethanol solution. Cells that have thick peptidoglycan layers in their cell walls are much less affected by the decolorizing agent; they generally retain the crystal violet dye and remain purple. However, the decolorizing agent more easily washes the dye out of cells with thinner peptidoglycan layers, making them again colorless. Finally, a secondary  **counterstain** , usually  **safranin** , is added. This stains the decolorized cells pink and is less noticeable in the cells that still contain the crystal violet dye. And later, the slide is viewed under a microscope.
