**3.Instructional Strategy**

Name of Instructional Strategy : Expository

Assessment Method: Submmative assessment

Description:

Step by step instructions are provided at each level in the simulator to make it more user friendly. Stained microbes will show prominent structures. 

**4.Task &amp; Assessment Questions:**

Methylene blue is a 1. Acidic dye 2. Basic dye 3. Oxazine dye 4. **Neutral dye** **3.**. If only one stain is used for staining a specimenA. **Simple staining** B. Negative stainingC. Differential staining D. None of these4. Other than the sample (specimen) the remaining portion is stained then it is calleda. Simple staining b. Negative stainingc **. Differential staining** d. None of these |
| 3. | LO3 Identify and differentiate between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria | Analyze structures of microbes | 1. Gram positive bacteria appear as 1. Pink 2. **Voilet** 3. None 4. Both A &amp; B 1. The action of alcohol during Gram staining- 1. Allows the colour 2. It adds colour 3. **Decolourises the cells** 4. None of these |
| 4. | LO4 Analyze microbial structures | Interpret results | 1. Gram negative bacteria appear as **A. Pink** 1. Voilet 2. None 3. Both A &amp; B 2. Gram positive bacteria are usually susceptible to A. StreptomycinB. Tetracyclin **C. Penicillin** D. Ampicilliin3. During staining for Electron Microscopy, the method which improves contrast of specimen isPositive staining b. **Negative staining** c. Shadow staining d. None of these |
