| **Lab** | **Food Microbiology (KFT 352)** |
| **Experiment** | **3. Simple and differential staining of microorganisms and their examination.** |

**About the Lab(objective):**

The microbiology lab is designed to study the microbes. The lab involves the basic techniques of sterilizing media/glassware and growing microorganisms on specific media. Preparation of media and use of autoclave is conducted to prepare pure cultures and analyse contaminated food. Samples are taken from various natural and processed food. The growth of of microbes on media is later used to analyze the contamination of food.

**About the Experiment:**

The experiment is designed to the stain the microbes so as to analyze their structure, identify/characterize their species/genus and predict their toxicity in contaminated foods.
